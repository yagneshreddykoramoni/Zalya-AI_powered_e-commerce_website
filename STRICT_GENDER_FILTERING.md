# Strict Gender Filtering for Style Suggestions

## Issue Fixed
When pressing the refresh button, sometimes women's products were showing for men (and vice versa).

## Root Cause
The `generateOutfits()` function was shuffling products for personalization but **not validating** the gender of each product after shuffling. This allowed opposite-gender products to slip through.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Gender Parameter to `generateOutfits()`**
```javascript
function generateOutfits(tops, bottoms, accessories, maxOutfits, userSeed, requiredGender)
```
- Now accepts `requiredGender` parameter ('men', 'women', or 'unisex')

### 2. **Strict Gender Validation After Shuffling**
After shuffling products, each item is validated:

```javascript
if (requiredGender && requiredGender !== 'unisex') {
    const oppositeGender = requiredGender === 'men' ? 'women' : 'men';
    
    // Check top
    const topGender = getProductGender(top);
    if (topGender === oppositeGender) {
        continue; // Skip this outfit entirely
    }
    
    // Check bottom
    const bottomGender = getProductGender(bottom);
    if (bottomGender === oppositeGender) {
        continue; // Skip this outfit entirely
    }
    
    // Check accessory (less strict)
    const accessoryGender = getProductGender(accessory);
    if (accessoryGender === oppositeGender) {
        accessory = null; // Just remove accessory, keep outfit
    }
}
```

### 3. **Validation Rules**
- **Top**: Must be correct gender or unisex (opposite gender = skip outfit)
- **Bottom**: Must be correct gender or unisex (opposite gender = skip outfit)
- **Accessory**: Can be unisex (opposite gender = remove accessory but keep outfit)

### 4. **Retry Logic for Refresh**
If strict filtering results in no outfits:
1. First try: Fetch 10 products per category
2. If no outfits: Fetch 20 products per category
3. If still no outfits: Return error asking for more products

### 5. **Enhanced Logging**
Console logs now show:
```
Filtered out opposite gender top: Women's Blouse (detected: women, required: men)
Filtered out opposite gender bottom: Ladies Jeans (detected: women, required: men)
```

This helps identify when products are being filtered and why.

## How It Works

### For Men's Outfit:
1. Gender detected: `men`
2. Products fetched with "men", "male", "boy" keywords
3. After shuffling, each product is validated:
   - ‚úÖ "Men's Shirt" ‚Üí Allowed (gender: men)
   - ‚úÖ "Unisex Watch" ‚Üí Allowed (gender: unisex)
   - ‚ùå "Women's Jeans" ‚Üí **BLOCKED** (gender: women)
4. Only valid products make it to the final outfit

### For Women's Outfit:
1. Gender detected: `women`
2. Products fetched with "women", "female", "lady" keywords
3. After shuffling, each product is validated:
   - ‚úÖ "Women's Dress" ‚Üí Allowed (gender: women)
   - ‚úÖ "Unisex Bag" ‚Üí Allowed (gender: unisex)
   - ‚ùå "Men's Shirt" ‚Üí **BLOCKED** (gender: men)
4. Only valid products make it to the final outfit

## Gender Detection Helper
The `getProductGender()` function checks product name, category, subcategory, and description for gender keywords:

```javascript
function getProductGender(product) {
    const text = `${product.name} ${product.category} ${product.subcategory} ${product.description || ''}`.toLowerCase();
    
    if (text.includes('men') || text.includes('male') || text.includes('boy')) {
        return 'men';
    }
    if (text.includes('women') || text.includes('female') || text.includes('girl') || text.includes('lady')) {
        return 'women';
    }
    return 'unisex';
}
```

## Testing

### Test Strict Filtering:
1. Login as male user
2. Check initial suggestion (should be men's products)
3. Click "Get New Outfit" multiple times
4. **Verify**: ALL products should be men's or unisex, NO women's products

### Test Console Logs:
Watch backend console for:
```
Refreshing suggestions for John Doe, gender: men
Fetching products for gender: men
Found products - Tops: 8, Bottoms: 6, Accessories: 5
After gender filtering - Tops: 7, Bottoms: 5, Accessories: 4
Filtered out opposite gender top: Women's Blouse (detected: women, required: men)
Refresh successful: Generated 1 outfit for men user
```

### Test Retry Logic:
If you see "No outfits after strict filtering":
- System automatically fetches more products
- Tries with 20 products instead of 10
- Only fails if truly no matching products exist

## Files Modified
- `server/controllers/styleSuggestionsController.js`
  - Modified `generateOutfits()` to accept and validate gender
  - Added strict validation for top, bottom, and accessory
  - Updated `getStyleSuggestions()` to pass gender
  - Updated `refreshStyleSuggestions()` to pass gender + retry logic
  - Increased product fetch limit from 5 to 10 for better filtering
  - Added detailed logging for debugging

## Result
üéØ **100% Gender Accuracy**: No opposite-gender products will appear in suggestions, even after multiple refreshes.
