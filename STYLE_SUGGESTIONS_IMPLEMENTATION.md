# Real-Time Style Suggestions Implementation

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Gender-Based AI Detection**
- Uses Groq AI (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) to detect gender from username
- Falls back to heuristic pattern matching if AI fails
- Supports: Male, Female, and Unisex categories
- Gender detection happens automatically on first load

### 2. **Smart Product Categorization**
- **Tops**: Shirts, blouses, t-shirts, tops, sweaters, hoodies, jackets, blazers
- **Bottoms**: Pants, jeans, trousers, shorts, skirts, leggings
- **Accessories**: Watches, belts, bags, hats, scarves, sunglasses, jewelry

### 3. **Complete Outfit Generation**
- Each outfit consists of:
  - 1 Top
  - 1 Bottom
  - 1 Accessory
- Up to 3 outfit combinations generated per user
- All products fetched from real database
- Products filtered by stock availability and rating

### 4. **Automatic 2-Day Refresh**
- Suggestions cached for 2 days
- Automatically updates after expiration
- Manual refresh button available
- Last update timestamp displayed

### 5. **Real-Time Database Integration**
- All products come from MongoDB Product collection
- Filters by gender-specific categories
- Sorts by rating and creation date
- Only shows in-stock items

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Server-Side

#### New Files Created:
1. **`server/controllers/styleSuggestionsController.js`**
   - `getStyleSuggestions()` - Get suggestions with 2-day cache
   - `refreshStyleSuggestions()` - Force refresh suggestions
   - `detectGenderFromName()` - AI-powered gender detection
   - `getCategorizedProducts()` - Fetch tops, bottoms, accessories
   - `generateOutfits()` - Create outfit combinations

2. **`server/routes/styleSuggestions.js`**
   - `GET /api/style-suggestions` - Get cached suggestions
   - `POST /api/style-suggestions/refresh` - Force refresh

#### Modified Files:
1. **`server/models/User.js`** - Added styleSuggestions schema:
```javascript
styleSuggestions: {
    gender: String,
    outfits: [{
        top: Mixed,
        bottom: Mixed,
        accessory: Mixed
    }],
    lastUpdated: Date
}
```

2. **`server/index.js`** - Registered new route:
```javascript
app.use('/api/style-suggestions', require('./routes/styleSuggestions'));
```

### Client-Side

#### New Files Created:
1. **`client/src/services/styleSuggestionsService.ts`**
   - API service for fetching and refreshing suggestions

#### Modified Files:
1. **`client/src/components/recommendations/OutfitSuggestions.tsx`**
   - Completely rewritten to use real-time data
   - Added loading and error states
   - Added manual refresh functionality
   - Display gender and last update time
   - Shows product images with proper URLs
   - Click to view individual products
   - Add complete outfit to cart

## 🎯 How It Works

### First Time Load
1. User opens Profile → Style Suggestions tab
2. Component calls `getStyleSuggestions()`
3. Server detects gender from username using AI
4. Server fetches categorized products from database
5. Server generates 3 outfit combinations
6. Results cached in user document with timestamp
7. Client displays outfits with images and details

### Subsequent Loads (< 2 days)
1. User opens Style Suggestions
2. Server checks `lastUpdated` timestamp
3. If less than 2 days old, returns cached data
4. Client displays cached outfits instantly

### After 2 Days
1. Cache expires automatically
2. Fresh suggestions generated with new products
3. New outfits stored in user document
4. Updated timestamp

### Manual Refresh
1. User clicks refresh button
2. Ignores cache
3. Generates fresh suggestions immediately
4. Updates user document

## 📋 API Endpoints

### GET /api/style-suggestions
**Auth Required**: Yes

**Response**:
```json
{
  "gender": "women",
  "outfits": [
    {
      "top": { /* Product object */ },
      "bottom": { /* Product object */ },
      "accessory": { /* Product object */ }
    }
  ],
  "lastUpdated": "2025-10-07T10:30:00.000Z",
  "cached": true
}
```

### POST /api/style-suggestions/refresh
**Auth Required**: Yes

**Response**: Same as GET but always fresh data (`cached: false`)

## 🎨 UI Features

### Visual Elements
- Loading spinner while fetching
- Error state with retry button
- Gender badge (Men/Women/Unisex)
- Last updated timestamp
- Refresh button
- 3-column grid for outfit items
- Product categories labeled (Top/Bottom/Accessory)
- Product names, prices, and images
- Hover effects on products
- "Add Complete Outfit" button

### User Interactions
- Click any product to view details
- Click refresh to get new suggestions
- Click "Add Complete Outfit" to add all 3 items to cart
- Automatic error handling with user feedback

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] Gender detection from username works
- [x] Products fetched from real database
- [x] Outfits contain top, bottom, and accessory
- [x] 2-day caching mechanism works
- [x] Manual refresh generates new outfits
- [x] Images display correctly with proper URLs
- [x] Product navigation works
- [x] Add to cart functionality works
- [x] Loading states display
- [x] Error handling works
- [x] Gender-specific filtering works
- [x] TypeScript types properly defined

## 💡 Gender Detection Examples

The AI will detect:
- **Male names**: John, Michael, David, Raj, Kumar, etc.
- **Female names**: Mary, Sarah, Jennifer, Priya, Anita, etc.
- **Unisex names**: Alex, Jordan, Casey, etc.

## 🔍 Product Filtering Logic

### For Male Users:
- Searches for products containing: "men", "male", "men's", "boy"
- Plus male-specific categories: suits, ties, blazers, cargo shorts

### For Female Users:
- Searches for products containing: "women", "female", "women's", "girl"
- Plus female-specific categories: dresses, skirts, blouses, heels

### For Unisex:
- Shows all available products without gender filtering

## 📝 Notes

- **AI Requirements**: Needs `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Database**: Requires Product collection with proper categories
- **Images**: Uses `getImageUrl()` helper for correct paths
- **Performance**: Caching reduces API calls and improves speed
- **Scalability**: Can handle thousands of products efficiently

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Color coordination between outfit items
- Season-based suggestions (summer, winter, etc.)
- Price range filtering
- User preference learning
- Social proof (trending outfits)
- Save favorite outfits
- Share outfits with friends
